   <img src="/images/Cevapi.jpg"/>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <p>600 g finely minced beef (1.3 pounds)
    300g finely minced lamb (or pork mince if you prefer) (10 oz)
    3 cloves garlic, minced
    1 teaspoon fine salt
    1 teaspoon black pepper</p> 
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, combine beef, lamb, and salt (plus other spices if you so desire)
        <br/>
        Knead the mixture with clean hands for 5 minutes
        <br/>
        Cover the meat with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight
        <br/>
        Uncover the meat and stir in minced garlic and black pepper
        <br/>
        Shape the mixture into small logs no longer or wider than an index finger  â€“ it is best to do this with wet hands, so the meat does not stick to you. Keep wetting your hands after each few that you roll
        <br/>
        Preheat your grill. Ideally, you should use a charcoal grill
        <br/>
        Brush the grill with some olive oil
        <br/>
        Grill the minced fingers on a medium heat until evenly grilled and browned on all sides
        <br/>
        Serve warm with Turkish flatbread and freshly chopped onion (and ajvar if you have it!)</p>
